        of displacement, and intentions to move. It links its findings to the results
        of the COVID-19 RRPS on health, education, and livelihoods. The SES provides

        "The Global Compact on Refugees represents a new approach to managing forced
        displacement situations, one in which evidence and data are central to its
        success and key to link humanitarian and development actions. The Kalobeyei
        Settlement, located in Turkana County along the northwestern border of Kenya,
        was established in 2015 as an alternative to a camp setting, based on principles
        of refugee self-reliance, integrated delivery of services to refugees and
        host community members, and greater support for livelihood opportunities through
        evidence-based interventions.\nIn Kenya, refugees are not systematically included
        in national surveys and, as a result, there is a lack of data on refugee poverty
        measures that is comparable to the national population. While the humanitarian-development
        approach used in Kalobeyei emphasizes the interconnectedness of refugees and
        host communities, the existing data sources do not lend themselves to easy
        comparison. The Kalobeyei Socioeconomic Profiling (SEP) Survey helps close
        data gaps by using micro-level data to understand the living conditions of
        refugees and ultimately inform policy and targeted programming. The SEP employed
        a novel approach to addressing this need by generating data that are statistically
        representative of the settlement''s population in 2018 and comparable to the
        Kenyan national survey measuring poverty from 2015/16.", "owner_org": "1f876a0b-de1b-4785-9b13-58cf1239dc7c",

        this survey a stratified, single-stage (i.e. non-clustered) sample design
        was applied. The four sub-camps of Kakuma were considered strata and the 126
        administrative blocks were considered sub-strata. All strata and sub-strata
        were retained for the sample. Within each of these sub-strata, a sample of
        households was drawn systematically via a random walk sampling process.\r\n\r\nThe

        that not all refugees in such protracted situations have the same humanitarian
        assistance needs, UNHCR and WFP decided to undertake a study among refugees
        in Kakuma Camp. The main aims were to fill knowledge gaps regarding refugee
        livelihoods and the level and differences of vulnerability in refugee households,
        as well as to explore the feasibility of delivering more differentiated assistance
        and to identify the mechanisms that would need to be put in place to do so.

        mechanism could be put in place or whether other ways of prioritising assistance
        exist when resources are tight. The survey covered 2,000 households and was
