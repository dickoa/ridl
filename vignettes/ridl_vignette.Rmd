## UNHCR Raw Internal Data Library (RIDL)

The [UNHCR RIDL platform](https://ridl.unhcr.org) is UNHCR internal platform to easily store, find and analyze raw data.
This package is not on yet on CRAN and to install it, you will need the [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package.
You can get `ridl` from Gitlab or Github (mirror)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("dickoa/ridl")
```

The `ridl` package requires you to add your API key and store it for further use. The easiest way to do that is to store your API key in your `.Renviron` file which is automatically read by R on startup.

You can retrieve your `API key` in your [user page](https://ridl.unhcr.org/user/).
